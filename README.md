# hangman-basak

Repo for creating a competitive way to hang Basak. If you guess the word, Basak hangs.
Else yell that word at him as he hobbles away :P

Currently consists of a simple command-line-running backend for hangman. Things to do:
- Develop API to talk to web framework
- Simple webframework in possibly Node.js
- Webpage design

Will start with a single player web-based UI and like to eventually get to a time-based multiplayer version.
